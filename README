FluidRefreshmentDB is a simple "essay" application that I'm using to
experiment with various geo related capabilities both in-browser and as data
served from FluidDB.

Current status: incomplete, hardly tested and unfinished.

Feedback most welcome.

The most interesting files are index.html and javascript/app.js

Makes heavy use of the excellent Sammy framework. See the comments in the
app.js file for more information.

A working version of this application can be found here:
